	<h2>Style: Northern Shaolin</h2>
	<p>Northern Shaolin is an external style based on extending the body and long, 
	aggressive techniques that explode and drive through the opponent. 
	Northern Shaolin dates back to the year 527, and is the origin of many martial arts. 
	Many of Shaolin's movements come from nature, utilizing the behaviors of various animals and the five Chinese elements, wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.
	Shaolin teaches students to use their energy to penetrate their opponents, sending it forward for thousands of miles. 
	Northern Shoalin fits the art of firebending because, like fire, it is aggressive, expanding, and extravagant.</p>
