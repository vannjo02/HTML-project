	<h2>Style: Ba Gua Zhang</h2>
	<p>An internal style like Tai Chi, Ba Gua is based around the eight trigrams of the Yijing. 
	"Baguazhang" translates into "eight trigram palm." 
	These can refer to the eight animals which Ba Gua movements are based on; Lion, Snake, Bear, Dragon, Phoenix, Rooster, Qilin, and Monkey. 
	'Circle walking' is used to train stance and movement. 
	This teaches the practitioner how to move and change direction without pausing or losing momentum, as well as staying behind the opponent's back. 
	The tactics used are outflanking and outmaneuvering. The inverse of Tai Chi, Ba Gua surrounds the opponent and delivers energy inward.

	The Ba Gua style of kung fu is what helps our favorite Avatar Aang fight the forces of the Fire Nation. 
	Using its array of circular, whirlwind motions, Aang is able to defend himself and his friends.</p>
