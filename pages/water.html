	<h1>Waterbending</h1>

	<h2>Style: Tai Chi</h2>
	<p>The Waterbenders use Tai Chi, an internal style that focuses on the control of energy. 
	It is a very soft, gentle and flowing, but devastating when mastered. 
	Tai Chi students learn to use little strength to defend themselves. 
	With Tai Chi, the practitioner creates circles to pass by attacking energy and issues their own energy outward. 
	While being used for combat, Tai Chi also serves as therapy for the purpose of health and longevity. 
	"Tai Chi" literally translates into "Incredible Energy," and it earns its title.
	
	Being an art of both healing and combat, Tai Chi is the perfect match for waterbending.</p>
