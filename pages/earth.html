	<h2>Style: Hung Gar</h2>
	<p>The Earth Kingdom utilizes the Hung Gar system, a mix of the Tiger and Crane animal styles. 
	This style uses deep, low stances, such as the hose stance, and strong hand techniques. 
	Hung Gar is one of the more external styles, but also practices some internal movement. 
	Emphasis is put on having firm, solid stances. The more connected to the Earth one is, the more power they will have. 
	The Chinese character "Hung" is a family name which means "to stand firm and tall with integrity."

	With a focus on strong, balanced stances and powerful strikes, Hung Gar is an earthbender's best weapon.</p>

	<h1>Toph</h1>

	<h2>Style: Southern Praying Mantis</h2>
	<p>Southern Praying Mantis is a close range style that focuses the arms while keeping leg work to a minimum, using low and short range kicks. 
	Like Hung Gar, Southern Praying Mantis originates from southern China. 
	Practitioners strengthen the arms and keep them extended in order to reduce the recoil needed to gather energy for the next strike. 
	This style was inspired by a mantis defeating a bird, and is apparent by the footwork that Southern Praying Mantis utilizes.

	Southern Praying Mantis is a unique martial art and is the basis for Toph's unique style of earthbending.</p>
